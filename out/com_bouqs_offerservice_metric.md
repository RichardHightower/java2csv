## Class: MetricService

**com.bouqs.offerservice.metric.MetricService**

```java
@Service
public class MetricService 
```
The MetricService class is a software service class that provides functionality for managing and tracking metrics within a system. It is annotated with @Service, indicating that it serves as a service component in a larger application.

The class includes a single method called increment, which takes a metric label as input and increments the associated metric value. This method is responsible for updating the metrics in the system.

The class also includes several fields for managing logging and configuration. It contains a private final Logger field named log, which is used for logging information related to the MetricService class. This allows for easier debugging and monitoring of the metrics functionality.

Additionally, the class has a field named metricsConfig, which likely holds the configuration settings related to metrics tracking. It is used for managing and accessing the configuration properties required for metric tracking.

Lastly, the class includes an @Value annotated field named environment, which holds the value of the "spring.profiles.active" property. This allows the MetricService class to dynamically access and utilize the active profile in the Spring application, enabling environment-specific metric tracking.

Overall, the MetricService class provides a simple yet robust way to manage and track metrics within a software system, making it a valuable component for any software engineer working on metric-related functionality.
### Method: increment
```java
public void increment(String metricLabel) {
    Optional.ofNullable(metricLabel).orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("metric label cannot be empty"));
    log.debug("metric before increment: {}", metricLabel);
    Optional<MeterRegistry> meterRegistry = metricsConfig.getMeterRegistry();
    meterRegistry.ifPresent(meterReg -> {
        meterReg.counter(metricLabel, "environment", environment).increment();
    });
}
```

### increment Overview 

The `increment` method in the `MetricService` class is used to increment a counter metric identified by the `metricLabel` parameter. It first checks if the `metricLabel` is null or empty, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if it is. Then, the method logs the value of the `metricLabel` for debugging purposes. 

Next, it retrieves the `MeterRegistry` object from the `metricsConfig` and applies a conditional logic to increment the counter metric if the `MeterRegistry` is present. The counter metric is incremented by calling the `increment` method on the counter identified by the `metricLabel`, along with additional tags such as the "environment" tag, which is set to the value of the `environment` variable.

The purpose of this method is to increment a counter metric within the application's metrics system, allowing the monitoring and tracking of specific metrics related to the application's performance or behavior.


### increment Step by Step  

The increment method in the MetricService class, located in the com.bouqs.offerservice.metric package, performs the following steps:

1. It takes a parameter called metricLabel, which represents the label of the metric to be incremented.

2. It first checks if the metricLabel parameter is not null. If it is null, it throws an IllegalArgumentException with the message "metric label cannot be empty".

3. It logs a debug message stating the value of the metricLabel before incrementing. This message is useful for debugging purposes.

4. It retrieves the MeterRegistry object from the metricsConfig. The MeterRegistry is a component used for managing and collecting metrics.

5. If the MeterRegistry object is present, it executes the following steps within the if block:

   - It calls the counter method on the MeterRegistry, which records the number of occurrences of a particular event or operation.

   - The counter method takes the metricLabel as the first parameter and sets its value as the metric label for this counter.

   - It also defines a tag "environment" with the value of the environment variable.

   - Finally, it increments the value of the counter by one by calling the increment method on the counter.

That's all there is to it! The increment method increments a metric by one, using the specified metric label and environment tag.
